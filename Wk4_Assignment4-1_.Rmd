Introduction and research questions

*a. Introduction,purpose and scope.*

Earlier research shown that romantic relationships have a significant effect on the academic performance of male students, resulting in a lower GPA (Honghao, & Tianyu, 2021).
This study attempt to explore the relationship between romantic relationship and absences.
The major variables used to answer the research question includes romantic and student's absence in school.

b.  Describe the research question.

Is there a relationship between student in a romantic relationship and being absence in school?
If there's, is it statistically significant?

b.  Give a rationale for studying the relationship between romantic relationship and absences. Why do you think romantic relationship would explain variation in absences?

Students in adolescents stage are likely to experience distraction, stress, and low academic performance due to infatuation and romantic relationships.
Therefore, being in a romantic relationship is associated with increased class absences.

ii. Include the word equation.

$$
Absence = {\beta}_0+{\beta}_1Romatic
$$

***loading data***

```{r}
library(readr)
student_mat_1 <- read_csv("student-mat-1.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
#View(student_mat_1)

```

a.  What are the frequencies of the categorical demographic variables?

```{r}
student_mat_1 |>
  select(romantic,school, sex,famsize,Pstatus)|>
  tbl_summary(by = romantic,
              type = all_continuous() ~ "continuous2",
              statistic = all_continuous() ~ c(
              "{N_nonmiss}",
              "{median} ({p25}, {p75})",
              "{min}, {max}"))|>
  add_overall() |>
  modify_header(label ~ " ") |>
  bold_labels() |>
  as_gt() |>
  # modify with gt functions
  gt::tab_header("Table 1: EDA of the categorical demographic variables")|> 
  gt::tab_spanner(
    label = "Romantic variable",  
    columns = starts_with(c("stat_1","stat_2")))|> 
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = "small",
    data_row.padding = gt::px(2))
  

```

a.  What are the five-number summaries of your quantitative demographic variables?

```{r}
student_mat_1|>summarise(
                Minimum =  min(age),
                Q1      =  quantile(age,0.25),
                `Median (Q2)` =  median(age),
                Q3      =  quantile(age,0.75),
                Maximum =  max(age))|> gt()
```

a.  Provide descriptive statistics of your outcome and explanatory variable.

```{r}
favstats(absences~romantic, data = student_mat_1)|>gt()
student_mat_1|>group_by(romantic)|>summarise(
                Minimum =  min(absences),
                Q1      =  quantile(absences,0.25),
                Mean    =  mean(absences),
                `Median (Q2)` =  median(absences),
                `Standard Deviation (SD)` = sd(absences),
                Q3      =  quantile(absences,0.75),
                Maximum =  max(absences))|> gt()
```

a.  Create a histogram of the absences variable. Reference the figure in your report. What do you see? Describe the shape, center, skewness, and weirdness.

```{r}
student_mat_1 |>
  ggplot( aes(x=absences)) +
    geom_histogram( binwidth=3, fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    ggtitle("Histogram for absences") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size=15,hjust = 0.5)
    )
```

b\.
Provide a visualization of the research question.
Reference the figure in your report.
What do you see?

```{r}
student_mat_1 |>
  ggplot( aes(x=absences)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(color = romantic, fill = romantic), 
                position = "identity", bins = 30, alpha=0.5) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="top")+
  ggtitle("Histogram illustrating absences distribution")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=15,hjust = 0.5))
    
```

3.  Research Question: Absences explained by Romantic
4.  Empty model: Fit the empty model for your outcome.

```{r}
Emptymodel = lm(absences~NULL,data = student_mat_1)
```

3.  Now that you have estimates of your parameter(s), put them into a model statement (see Ch. 7.2).

```{r}
summary(Emptymodel)
```

3.  Based on the model output and model statement, interpret the estimated parameter(s). What do the numbers mean?

<!-- -->

b.  Explanatory Model: Add your explanatory variable to the model.
c.  How is 𝑋" coded?

```{r}
student_mat_1 = student_mat_1|>mutate(romantic = ifelse(romantic=='yes',1,0))
model = lm(absences~romantic,data = student_mat_1)

```

ii. Now that you have estimates of your parameter(s), put them into a model statement (see Ch. 7.2).

```{r}
summary(model)
```

ii. Based on the model output and model statement, interpret the estimated parameter(s). What do the numbers mean?
iii. Comparing the two models
iv. Create an APA-style table of the supernova() table in your document. Discuss your findings in reference to the table, including a discussion of the F ratio, degrees of freedom, and the difference in the number of parameters between the models.
v.  What is the proportion reduction in error (PRE), and what does it mean? What can you say about the strength of the model from PRE?
vi. What is Cohen’s d, and what does it mean? What can you say about the strength of the model from Cohen’s d?
vii. Conclusion
viii. What you have learned from your models in relation to the research question? Was the research question supported?
ix. Do you believe there are any limitations to your analysis? For example, sample size, bias, missing data, mistakes, measurement error, sampling error, unrepresentative sample, etc.?
